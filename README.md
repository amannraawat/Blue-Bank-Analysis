# Blue Bank Analysis Project

In this project, first I focused on cleaning the dataset using Python to ensure its use for the analysis and make good insights from the data. I used Python libraries like pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. The process resulted in a significant improvement in data quality, enhancing its reliability and consistency. This clean dataset now provides a foundation for further analysis and decision-making processes.
